This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.\n- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.\nNearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated.\n- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.\n- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates.\n- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.\n- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization.\n- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks.\n- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n  \n</details>","published":"2022-07-02T09:36:53.033379Z","updated":"2023-09-24T21:04:19.380872Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":696426,"followers":423,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["52gcrxOy","suKMGRbi","V7JZgyIU","TnN4CV2Q","c4RHSmo9","WTmxKPaw","ibGbqBbP","w6asrex4","JEoSJNGo","v1Byy3O4","qSw3a67v","ySmWhbfP","QrS8ZpUH","lCbMhmSa","Hlexif59","uqcWRM8W","9DCa1IzX","6YKudvQ5","vkRZleVy","iLEHOlRR","17IcFh9q","KoZMxzwB","YDAuLUY8","bmmEZ4mh","VKligEsm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"bmmEZ4mh","project_id":"4ZqxOvjD","author_id":"OGBzw79h","featured":false,"name":"Rubidium mc1.19.2-0.6.2c","version_number":"0.6.2c","changelog":"- Add option to create the OpenGL context (better performance)\n- Fixed CTM\n- Fixed block and item emissives (thanks to embeddedt for an ideas)\n- Fixed incorrect Cloud rendering in modded dimensions\n- Fixed CodeChickenLib compatibility\n- Using Forge particle culling system now (better performance)\n- Fixed incorrect Fluid culling\n- Fixed not working Leaves option\n- Fixed not working Vignette option\n- More parity with Forge in Ambient Occlusion and Lighting\n- Memory leak fix in cloud rendering\n- Correct Immersive Engineering wire rendering in multiplayer\n- Some multipart models fixes\n- Fixed Donation button width\n- Code cleanups\n- Removed incorrect LICENSE file","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T12:11:21.248052Z","downloads":125818,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e67ef350e8247d83b33459dae8951f396ae341df","sha512":"fec97026d95868004c8c4e4e9a7210a94db3b950683bf29010dae1cf08502dc5047e6612279eb9af87f85f143e4799b71b34277f9dd17759244354e27eb0f0f7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/versions/bmmEZ4mh/rubidium-mc1.19.2-0.6.2c.jar","filename":"rubidium-mc1.19.2-0.6.2c.jar","primary":true,"size":1407451,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CsqDoH4a","user":{"id":"OGBzw79h","username":"Asek3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64613894?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-02T09:26:04.535310Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rubidium-mc1.19.2-0.6.2c.jar"},"mods\\caelus-forge-1.19.2-3.0.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"11141abfb145983c207499bb89a3bd3673b0888b8b7d01a43e81c97586628ae5ca3ad0d2c9558c33ef0ddd80c15ca9b091c1752487ccf7eb70f37e2cc9c836b3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"40FYwb4z","slug":"caelus","project_type":"mod","team":"Ivmlfhgw","title":"Caelus API","description":"A coremod and API to provide developers access to elytra flight mechanics through an entity attribute.","body":"Caelus is a small utility mod that abstracts the hardcoded vanilla elytra behavior into a more generic elytra flight attribute and exposes this to mod developers seeking to implement elytra flight for their own mods.\n\nAll modders have to do is call the CaelusAPI.ELYTRA_FLIGHT attribute where applicable.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## üêõ Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## üéÅ How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ‚ùì What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

do.\n\nI've created a video explaining how to customize Scriptor in-depth.\nCheck it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLaZzCKMcQA).\n\nWelcome to Scriptor, the mod which gives words power.\nThis Vanilla-style mod adds various kinds of magic spell to the world\nwith the aim of making discovery and spellcrafting simple, interesting,\nand reasonable when compared to Vanilla gear and capabilities.\n\nIn this mod, spells are constructed much like sentences, with a catch:\n\n**The words and sentence structure used are random in every world!**\n\nFor the average player, plenty of spells can be obtained in each world,\nbut for anyone dedicated enough, you can reverse engineer these spells\nand learn how to draft even more powerful spells yourself.\n\nFor information on usage and such, check out the docs on \n[GitHub](https://github.com/ssblur/scriptor/blob/main/doc/README.md)\nor explore the world in game to learn more about how magic works for\nyou.\n\n## Special

Delight","description":"A cozy expansion to farming and cooking!","body":"<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wqSocVR.png\">\n</p>\n\nFarmer's Delight is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, brand new **tools and weapons** to hunt and gather with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the Advancements!** They explain many of the basic concepts, and are a good place to start from.\n\nPick up any item, then press the **L** key (by default) to open the Advancements screen. Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":598447,"followers":754,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"rFTKVUtq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.19.2","version_number":"1.19.2-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen.

In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts¬†‚Äî the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature¬†‚Äî Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-02-19T23:44:10.212939Z","updated":"2024-05-17T01:09:15.879520Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1036538,"followers":869,"categories":["adventure","decoration","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["Ge5jWFMt","LC6CBpn9","deDT156J","8Gq5f3b9","NySrIdMV","KAarwq7Z","kWtjzB64","uol0Ji2G","CogRXOHi","16pSLk6u","CthwWOrc","N2yKMcSO","gTTPcjUR","XzRYWtHN","tS9cnHTd","f3PibvQR","W4uRBVaV","9iPMgrMe","449b2DDy","YouhzPUf","iYszV4T0","RmyDSPdb","fQyD1cxI","kuHlZxVW","vKRSJIfJ","lrZS6PH1","qqIjSslt","QplnGAIz","wtF2F6Ax","lQXMx7kq","2nUEz0zq","FL88RLRu","jJn0Zg8g","W7R83Bhr","oVphbTam","IHNXXJ1L","BxEPEvgo","kDpdIch6","98DJ9gap","VYtNUWOc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z2mXHnxP/c89b02a675b204bfbe1d7e494769e425355e23f9.png"},"version":{"id":"9iPMgrMe","project_id":"Z2mXHnxP","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.19.2] v1.0.6 (Forge)","version_number":"1.19.2-Forge-1.0.6","changelog":"Depends on YUNG's API 1.19.2-Forge-3.8.8.<br />\n\n<u>Changelog</u>\n<ul>\n<li>Create pieces will now be present in every fortress if using Create.

The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-05-24T01:59:38.050072Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":806182,"followers":304,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG","1aZiIHQO","nRQ4FbAf","UfNitWgy","AQ384Hch","1C6lBZmu","L0Tw2xgL","7Wei6s2K","9ro67WYY","adn5hcLm","TOk3Lved","WHmuOhGH","kKPFv8aa","DmFR6XO3","nJQvdzJp","YGa5gGxr","6EgL0aP4","7UxKaIU0","nyvHHyUE","wlGMHF77","29pH8hdz","CP6RHJq7","BiiqnvUy","suXbeF6v","tF9CH5Oa","TeuWjj6h","78rIk4rg","Ao2ykrAI","d3pyf6MJ","moWmAnjY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"29pH8hdz","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-1.19.2-5.1.6.2","version_number":"1.19.2-5.1.6.2","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

Please read before using ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nThis mod is renaming / moving your mod files, for this reason it is important that you have regular\nbackups in place.\nI will do my best to implement corresponding safety features to avoid possible issues, but I'm not\nable to cover all use cases.\n\n## üëæAutomatic Server Bundle (one mod pack for client/server)\n\nThis mod automatically disable mods which are incompatible or not needed on the server side.\nThere is no longer the need to have a separated \"server\" and \"client\" mod pack only for the mods.\n\n## üëæ Automatic Mod Cleanup\n\nThis mod automatically clean up duplicated files, by removing older versions.\nThis is helpful to avoid duplication issues and manual deleting of older versions.\n\n## How to use the mod ?\n\nJust add the mod to your mod pack and during the start on a Minecraft Client or a Minecraft Server\nit will automatically optimize the mods in the mod folder.\n\nIf the mod is used on a server all client related mods will be automatically renamed to \"\n???.client\".\nThe mod is mostly helpful if it is used on the server and the client side.\n\n## Example Mod Pack\n\nIf you want to see this mod in action, please take a look at:\nhttps://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/bos-adventure-world\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è More Information\n\nPlease take a look at our wiki

[Botarium](https://modrinth.com/mod/botarium) to work\n\nHere are the features features:\n- Electricity generation using large spinning copper coils with magnets.\n- Motors (Not just one motor!) which can generate rotation from electricity.\n- Energiser which lets you craft a few new items using rotation and electricity.\n- Multi block nuclear reactors which can easily generate tons of heat that can be used in Create's boilers to boil water for your steam engines.\n- Wires that allow one to transfer energy around easily.\n- Solar panels which can generate heat.\n- A heat system which allows you to transfer heat generated by solar panels and nuclear reactors to other places.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is this addon compatible with Create: Crafts & Additions?\nYes, the two addons should be able to work together.\n### I don't like some unrealistic parts of this mod, is there an easy way to remove them?\nThere is a datapack builtin into this mod called \"Create: New Age [Monkey Edition]\" which removes recipes for a few magnets, removes recipes for the first tiers of the energiser leaving only the last one, removes recipes for overcharged iron, gold and diamond as well as modifies the recipes that use them.\n### Can I configure this mod?\nYes.\n","published":"2023-08-16T17:31:04.749014Z","updated":"2024-02-04T17:48:50.435487Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":190696,"followers":158,"categories":["technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["m8YprJWF","w4tgCPFK","RCECmmih","Mgs69J99","B3pDiU3b","WzRb0DBJ","rWaKt59k","ao3q73HP","EZOMcIeF","CqRrkNGx","fxl3gvEu","WCDx7Wfc","jqMmLNLe","a6W08wcK","B7bCM6IZ","1PPcbRSB","ioExlpoB","7BLYh3Vj","9w7r8hfq","9VZpPXFq","HuzzzYL6","vMKWsHwr","tgLRjftY","hExvnyfK","dWpdPzIU","rrNIuoca","zco5jNBv","OHszECIT","UMQnwuOr","N9ynh7Qk","Za0g1RgO","Cz3GTbgJ","rvYVvldk","rk63oafd","bLna6SZ1","2BEeSV7E"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FTeXqI9v/fe75695f6f2e085ac9fb56204de7f88b6d716e8d.png"},"version":{"id":"bLna6SZ1","project_id":"FTeXqI9v","author_id":"kgc7JcMg","featured":true,"name":"v1.1.2

Mobs","description":"Adds new attacks and abilities to a variety of mobs.","body":"Have you ever felt that after a while, Minecraft gets too easy? Have you ever wished that you could make it more challenging without the glass cannon nature of the hard difficulty? Have you ever found fighting mobs boring and monotonous due to their simplistic nature?\n\nIf the answer to any of those questions is yes, this is the datapack for you. Upgraded Mobs is a datapack/server-side mod that adds new attacks, mechanics, and features to many of the mobs you know and love.\n\n### Details\nAll of the changes and additions in this project are detailed below.\n\n<details>\n<summary>All</summary>\nAll mobs have increased follow range, allowing them to see you from farther away. Their movement speed is also increased slightly to make running away a little bit harder.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Zombies</summary>\nZombies (including drowned, husks, and zombie villagers) receive two upgrades that make fighting a horde a little more threatening:\n\n- All zombies are capable of breaking doors, regardless of the difficulty.\n- Periodically, zombies will dash at a nearby player.\n- Unique to this dash is a bite attack that deals extra damage. This attack can be blocked, but be warned, it will eat through your shield quickly!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Drowned</summary>\nIn addition to the default zombie dash/bite, drowned get the following two changes:\n\n- Drowned swim faster now, on top of the default movement buff for all mobs.\n- If a player is above water, drowned will periodically pull them deeper underwater in an attempt to, well, drown them. This can even happen if you are traveling above them in a boat. Watch out for hordes!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Elder Guardians</summary>\nElder guardians have been upgraded to be full fledged boss mobs.\n\n- Elder guardians have 300 HP, same as the vanilla wither.\n- In combat, elder guardians will periodically debuff a random player with weakness, slowness, and/or blindness.\n- If no guardians are nearby, an elder guardian will periodically summon mini-guardians that disappear after a short time.\n- Below half HP, elder guardians will periodically turn invisible.\n- To compensate for all of this, the chance of dropping a Tide armor trim is increased to 100%.\n\nA video demonstrating this is shown below. It is slightly outdated, however, as instant damage on the periodic debuff has been removed. Coincidentally, it also demonstrates the new drowned features!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlpjHU2KDd8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Evokers</summary>\nEvokers are now mini-bosses that receive the following upgrades:\n \n- Evokers now have 150 HP, and while below half HP, they gain Regeneration 1.\n- Evokers also hold a totem of undying in their off-hand that must be popped before killing them. This doesn't change combat with them that much, but it does make sense thematically.\n- Whenever an evoker uses their fang attack, it will also follow up with two more waves of fangs in the same place.\n- To compensate for all of this, vexes now die immediately if there aren't any evokers nearby.\n\nFurthermore, two admin functions `upgradedmobs:evokers/raid_loot/enable` and `upgradedmobs:evokers/raid_loot/disable` are added. While enabled, evokers spawned during raids won't drop a totem anymore. Instead, they can drop golden apples, enchanted books, and lapis lazuli. This is disabled by default.\n</summary>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Piglin Brutes</summary>\nWhile their damage is untouched, piglin brutes now receive a few upgrades that make it harder to fight them than just knocking them back while you stand still:\n\n- Brutes have 75% knockback resistance by default.\n- Brutes will periodically dash at nearby players.\n- Brutes will *also* throw the closest player or wither skeleton high into the air. Watch out for lava!\n- Brutes have a small chance of spawning with random pieces of netherite armor, or with knockback on their axe.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Pillagers</summary>\nPillagers aren't holding back anymore.\n\n- Some pillagers will shoot weakness arrows or even firework rockets instead of regular arrows.\n- Some pillagers will also have Quick Charge II crossbows.\n- The above two upgrades are applied more often during raids.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Spiders</summary>\nEveryone *loves* spiders.\n\n- Spiders will periodically dash at nearby players.\n- They will also periodically trap the closest player in a cobweb. Remember to use a sword to break out!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Witches</summary>\nFor as rare as they are, witches are a little too easy.\n\n- Witches now have 60 HP.\n- Splash potions thrown by witches have a 25% chance of being lingering potions instead.\n- If a player is nearby, splash potions have a 10% chance of inflicting blindness.\n</details>\n\n### Configuration\nDon't like some of the features listed above? Want to adjust some of the probabilities? Want to give a modded mob some of these features? While there is no config file, you can open up the datapack ZIP to edit things yourself:\n\n- If you add a `#` symbol in front of a command in an `mcfunction` file, that line will be commented out and won't be ran.\n- You can integrate other mobs via the tag system. For example, if you have a mod that adds a new type of zombie, you can add it to the `upgradedmobs:zombies` entity tag. Note that you can also do this in an external datapack by adding the same tag file but with the `replace` key set to `false`.\n- This datapack includes a list of predicates for random probabilities. If you want to change a probability, you can replace the associated predicate with a different one, or make your own.\n- If you want to exclude individual mobs (e.g. custom bosses) from the features in this datapack to make sure nothing is overwritten, give them the `upgradedmobs.blacklist` tag.\n\nIf you want to uninstall this datapack, you can simply remove it from your world with no issues. However, buffs to HP, follow range and movement speed, and the like that were already made can't be reverted.\n\n### Credits\nI can't take credit for all of this. Below includes a few sources that I used while making this:\n- Some mechanics were taken from TheGayerest's old [Tougher Everything](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/tougher-everything/) and [Tougher Bosses](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/tougher-bosses-full-release/) datapacks, with permission given by the original author.\n- Some inspiration was taken from Kindred408's old [Smart Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/minecraft-but-mobs-are-smart/) datapack, although the actual implementation in this datapack is my original work.\n\n### Other Datapacks\nI recommend the following datapacks, in addition to this one:\n- [Vanilla Parity](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-parity) replaces the Wither with the Bedrock Wither.\n- The old datapacks [Blaze Tweaks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blaze-tweaks/) and [Pillager Tweaks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/pillager-tweaks/) by FlanDere allow blazes and pillagers to move backwards when a player approaches them, like crossbow piglins do (and forward, in the case of blazes).\n- My other packs! Check them out on my Modrinth page :)\n\nCompatibility-wise, this datapack should usually be fine. However, watch out for the following:\n- Datapacks like [Incendium](https://modrinth.com/mod/incendium) that have mobs or bosses with custom AI and features won't be overwritten (except for when this pack buffs a mobs HP and such), but this datapack's mechanics will also be applied, which may have unintended consequences. \n- For example, FlanDere also has a cool [Jumping Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/jumping-mobs-java-datapack-original-by-pheonixsc/) datapack, but dashes and jumps don't mix well (the mob can bounce really high accidentally).\n- Remember to give the `upgradedmobs.blacklist` tag to any mob that you don't want to be affected by this datapack.","published":"2023-07-16T21:30:03.271954Z","updated":"2024-05-19T18:59:10.115982Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":26509,"followers":161,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","mobs"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Wcyiwkk8","WfWa7W5Z","byaVcmWw","B27Jdn1h","WYxx2C6V","RLvFCnae","rZ9JXMWZ","OLtpSLx7","ZkgXODwQ","Ho1Cb96h","34P8Wlp0","F16FOXz5","VO7FHcYq","FmMnnJfw","yfjLj5MK","cslakmgp","Qo6whabR","6kQgoxtY","OCMDeiMC","vthXuJMV","m4OVQv5L","KqFvKo2a"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iaFWBDP2/93f7090381019e87d20aee342027af07a57fe73b.webp"},"version":{"id":"KqFvKo2a","project_id":"iaFWBDP2","author_id":"gBflFHI3","featured":false,"name":"1.3.3 - Mod","version_number":"1.3.3+mod","changelog":"Updates `/attribute` format to 1.20.5/6 (fixes a bug with two functions)\n\nRemoves elder guardian loot table change","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-19T18:59:11.216074Z","downloads":494,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"42fa5c79be0d9f26394731af2cc7c6fc389757fb24f31711e48dc9132b502a6f7e1648bf9766c3fdfa408b225aab77306c63195d6c3772205d1ca129a4002ef9","sha1":"383c2dc1b9a6f7d2a28c2084be5a6f144e44e935"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iaFWBDP2/versions/KqFvKo2a/upgraded-mobs-1.3.3.jar","filename":"upgraded-mobs-1.3.3.jar","primary":true,"size":42600,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"3UJegn17","user":{"id":"gBflFHI3","username":"badooga","name":"badooga","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/gBflFHI3/eefdb6deb9611c85ebedfec41beca7bc94a20ff2.png","bio":"I make stuff sometimes.\n\nSocials: linktr.ee/badooga","created":"2023-04-25T06:34:27.528489Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"upgraded-mobs-1.3.3.jar"},"mods\\create_crystal_clear-0.2.1-1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"41d008cbda817b96cc14a84bf3d689eb1a14bdd997d7180841cf08507ea22b5312560be9c619960213b9d4cb8e808e3257f43d7ed9f9cdeea373e6f6177cce06","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"h7QgiH72","slug":"create-crystal-clear","project_type":"mod","team":"6pNErcPO","title":"Create: Crystal Clear","description":"[FORGE] A mod that adds glass casings to create","body":"![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833251107336880128/1111903679235235870/2023-05-26_23.28.06.png)\n\n***Installation Requirements***\n\nThis mod requires [Create 0.5.1.a+](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) in order to work.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too.

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-05-16T18:29:48.419704Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3397191,"followers":3477,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"pQo2WjRY","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.3","version_number":"3.4.3","changelog":"Changes:\n\n-

This means it can be used alongside other mods that add inventory features, such as Quark or Inventory Sorter, without having to worry about clashes in functionality. As no default behaviour is overriden by this mod, it can be used Plug-and-Play without having to worry about configurations first.\n\nThis mod does not add inventory sorting.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>.

You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\".

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-05-20T09:13:19.597007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":493393,"followers":525,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W","NoFBkXQe","9Vscdpuz","CEmkqbKV","qpG9cRjY","fZYI0nmw","mfB8KDaB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qGKR0YVC","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":false,"name":"12.9.9

For Forge, it's available for 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20!</p>\n<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>\n<p>Q. How do I get support?<br>A. You can check out my Discord (linked below) or alternatively create an issue on our GitHub, which can be found by clicking on \"Issues\" above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What versions does Lootr support?<br>A. Currently, Lootr for Forge supports the following versions: 1.18, 1.19/1.19.1/1.19.2, 1.19.3. Please check the \"All Files\" page if you cannot find a download for the version of Minecraft you are playing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Is there a server-only version? Can I connect without installing it on the client?<br>A. No, <strong>Lootr is currently required on both the client and the server</strong>. If you have experience with plug-in development and are willing to help design a server-only version, please reach out on Discord (link found below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I change what loot is generated with Lootr? How do I include loot from other mods in Lootr containers?<br>A. <strong>This is beyond the scope of the Lootr mod</strong>, which simply changes the containers. In all other respects, loot is generated in exactly the same way as Vanilla chests generate it. Modifying loot tables is generally done via data packs, although various mods exist for various versions of Minecraft which do this. I recommend asking in your favourite modded Minecraft Discord or forum!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What about dungeon mods? How do I prevent players from going in and looting everything after it has already been cleared?<br>A. There are a number of options that help with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific loot tables can be blacklisted, which means that those chests will never be converted. You can also specify simply all loot tables of a certain mod. Likewise, specific dimensions can be blacklisted.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you can specify for certain containers (or all containers), determined by their loot table, to \"decay\". This means that a configurable time after they are first opened, the next time someone attempts to open the container, the block will be destroyed. There also exists the opposite, a system whereby chests will \"refresh\" (or re-generate their contents) after the configured period of time has elapsed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I prevent players from simply breaking containers?<br>A. By default, players who attempt to break a container will be given a warning message and a reminder that all containers are available per-player. Players can still break these containers by doing so while sneaking, unless this option is disabled in the configuration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I don't like the visual appearance of the containers. How can I change this?<br>A. There is a client-side option that forces containers to use the default Vanilla skin. However, this does mean there is no visual change to indicate if a container has been opened before.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Can I add Lootr to a pre-existing world and have containers be converted?<br>A. Yes! With one disclaimer: <strong>loot containers which were already opened will not be converted</strong>. The generation of loot in Minecraft, by default, removes the associated loot table, and there is no way for Lootr to find this information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. The container from &lt;random mod&gt; isn't converting!<br>A. If the container contains items (or always contains the same items), it is possible that the mod is manually generating loot for it. In this case, there is no way for Lootr to determine a loot table and convert chests. I recommend asking the author of the mod to consider switching to a loot table instead to maintain compatibility! If the container is empty, it is possible that it is merely included for the aesthetic. Otherwise, if you believe there's an issue with conversion, please open an issue on our GitHub tracker or post on Discord. Additional methods for converting containers exist for 1.12.2.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that the \"axe chest\" in the Vanilla Woodland Mansion does not have an associated loot table and is never converted.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I no longer want Lootr. What happens if I remove it?<br>A. <strong>Unfortunately, removing the mod will also remove all Lootr containers</strong>. There is currently no way to undo the conversion process.&nbsp;This means that every Lootr converted container will be removed from your world.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. I want to create a \"starter\" chest with some items in it for everyone in my world, how do I go about this? How do I create my own Lootr container?<br>A. Lootr also contains \"custom\" inventories which use the same visual appearance as a chest. Simply create a Vanilla chest, fill it with the items you want available and then, while standing on it, execute the&nbsp;/lootr custom&nbsp;command (this requires operator privileges).&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. What else does the&nbsp;/lootr command do?<br>A. For a full explanation of the command, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-command\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Command page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. How do I use Lootr in a mod pack, or how do I natively use Lootr in my Mod?<br>A. For a full explanation of Lootr's features for mod packs, as well as the Lootr API, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-for-Developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr for Developers page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q.

For a full explanation of Lootr's configuration, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-Configuration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Configuration page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage.

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only**¬†on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n¬† ¬†ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with¬†`ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10¬†);\n\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n¬† ¬†Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling¬†`ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling¬†`ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and¬†`ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n¬† ¬†builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> specialValue =¬†builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n¬† ¬†builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using¬†`ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n¬† ¬†builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values¬†`ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n¬† ¬†builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a concrete example of how to use Config Lib checkout [the example mod](https://github.com/SuperMartijn642/SuperMartijn642sConfigLib/blob/1.16/src/test/java/ExampleModConfig.java).\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\nCan I use your mod in my modpack?  \nYes, feel free to use my mod

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1639989,"followers":1728,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"Un7oJEL8","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.19+] Mouse Tweaks 2.23","version_number":"1.19-2.23-forge","changelog":"- Updated to Forge 41.0.94, fixing crashes with the new Forge versions.\n\nThe Fabric version does not have any changes so it stays at 2.22.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-07-12T02:57:28.725513Z","downloads":92664,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9d6e76a331c0598edb6293dc658af2d1672864b4","sha512":"ba7c37155f252ee10176d2209cd168a80dd9cecb999e815096f381ff8662bfd3c903c06619bb836c2ed5d1771f7de7bf3be0d7cf4d0ea1de989a92517a4b7b93"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/1.19-2.23-forge/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19-2.23.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19-2.23.jar","primary":true,"size":75983,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19-2.23.jar"},"mods\\CorgiLib-forge-1.19.2-1.0.0.34.jar":{"sha512":"e2c37e1294461e8e3be691c38ba0fed3d10630d110226a74af41a160392af7592fdd77eb436f80a052b6b7f8d33ec4dea020a10dff3b249d9c1d8be101ab9f45","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ziOp6EO8","slug":"corgilib","project_type":"mod","team":"C2nKtbZ6","title":"CorgiLib","description":"A library mod containing code used across Corgi Taco's mods.","body":"This is a mod containing code used in Corgi Taco's mods including the following helpful features:\n\n- `.json5` Config Serialization with Mojang's codecs.

has. Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π | Italiano | English | ƒåe&scaron;tina | ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ | –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ | Portugu&ecirc;s | –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ | Espa&ntilde;ol | “ö–∞–∑–∞“õ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (‰∏≠ÂõΩ) | ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá (È¶ôÊ∏Ø) | ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá (Âè∞ÁÅ£) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> üñºÔ∏è Media üñºÔ∏è </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>‚ùì F. A. Q. ‚ùì</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Me‚ù§Ô∏è\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

It's a hard life for a fish!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Ducks</strong>&nbsp;waddle around the Swamps, their feet slapping across the ground. They hold many secrets!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Dragonflies</strong>&nbsp;love buzzing around the Swamps! I found a note in a mineshaft that said they liked Chorus Fruit. I wonder what that's about?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lizards</strong>&nbsp;are the recluse of the Swamps and don't like people, but they're very loyal if fed their favorite food!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tortoises</strong>&nbsp;mosey around the Swamp in search of their next meal.

Don't provoke them or go&nbsp;near their cubs and you'll be fine... unless you're a Deer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Birds</strong> fly around the treetops, chirping as they do so. Maybe they'll be&nbsp;loyal to you in return for food.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Butterflies</strong> flutter about, looking for flowers (and crops) to pollinate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Caterpillars</strong> spawn by breeding butterflies and will crawl around, looking for nearby trees to create a chrysalis on.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Deer</strong> walk and run across the world, munching grass and avoiding Bears.&nbsp;I wonder if there's a way to mimic their movement?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Fireflies</strong> light up the night and can be found in biomes such as Forests,&nbsp;Plains, and Swamps. Would it be weird if you consumed one?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snails</strong> crawl around the forest floor... aimlessly. As Snails do. Be careful&nbsp;you don't jump on them, or they might meet an unkindly fate.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Snakes</strong> are lower forest predators, consuming the smaller animals&nbsp;that Bears can't be bothered to hunt.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">ü¶Å <strong>Deserted Drylands Update</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Dry biomes such as Savannas and Deserts are now inhabited by <strong>8 new animals</strong>; <strong>Lions</strong>, <strong>Giraffes</strong>, <strong>Elephants</strong>, <strong>Hippos</strong>, <strong>Rhinos</strong>, <strong>Vultures</strong>, <strong>Zebras</strong>, and <strong>Boars</strong>!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Lions</strong> are the rulers of the Savanna, and will hunt mobs at night. Be careful though, they won&rsquo;t hesitate to fight back!</span></li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Giraffes</strong> are gentle giants. If you feed them a Golden Apple, they&rsquo;ll allow you to ride them for 30 seconds. During this time, Maps&rsquo; radius are greatly increased. To breed them, use a Hay Bale!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Elephants</strong> mosey around, minding their own business. They fight back when attacked.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hippos</strong> tend to stay near the water, but watch out, because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> hungry! They&rsquo;ll attack boats and any Players that go into their pool. To breed them, feed them a Glistering Melon or a Melon Block while they&rsquo;re in the water.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rhinos</strong> are generally docile unless they have a baby with them. If aggro&rsquo;d, or if their baby is approached, they will scrape their foot 4-5 times before <em><strong>charging!</strong></em></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Vultures</strong> fly around, squawking in the air. Come nightfall, they&rsquo;ll attack <strong>Zombies.</strong> When Players are low on health, Vultures will swoop down, stealing the item in the Player&rsquo;s hand. If a Vulture steals an item, they&rsquo;ll carry it around while flying. If Rotten Flesh is dropped on the ground, they&rsquo;ll trade out the item they&rsquo;re holding.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Zebras</strong> are the Savanna&rsquo;s equivalent of Horses, and are tameable in a similar way. They&rsquo;re a slippery bunch though, and will run away if approached! However, once tamed, they run faster than Horses while in water, and can be chested.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Boars</strong> are neutral animals that replace Pigs in Savanna biomes. When attacked, they will fight back, and run away when low on health. I wonder what happens if they&rsquo;re struck by lightning..</span></li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For more detailed information about each mob, click <a href=\"https://starfish-studios.com/mods/naturalist\">here</a> to read our official wiki.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><b>‚ö†Ô∏è</b> Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;<b>‚ö†Ô∏è</b></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><strong>Q : Can I use this mod in my modpack or make videos about it?</strong><br />A : Yes!

It also adds a dungeon in the End (appears in the Void and Midlands biomes)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are several hammers in our mod: wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond and tungsten. Hammers are useful in combat, can be enchanted to spawn lightning bolts (when you sneak and hit with the Hammer)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099672953500745739/image.png\" /></p>\n<div class=\"QmZWSe\">\n<div class=\"QmZWSe\">\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099679784612663387/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>In the Awful Dungeons you can find a great local wildlife! You can find Incomplete Withers, wither skeleton having spent a large part of their life on Soul Sand and which infused them with their powers, they have more chance to drop Wither Skeleton skull.&nbsp;You can also meet Reinforced Blaze,&nbsp;Blazes who decided to equip themselves initially with Basalt which melted and created an alloy with their skin and made them very resistant but rather slow. This dungeon traps a boss from sordid experiments, the Awful Ghast. By releasing it with a Nether Star on its Altar, it has two combat phases. Firstly, it will attack you from a distance with projectiles that will make your items in hand temporarily useless and burn you. In a second time, it will dash on you and deal you very big damage.&nbsp;Once killed, it will drop Awful Crystals and an Awful Gun</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671438589448232/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>In this structure, you can find a new ore, Tungsten. This resource can be used to make tools and armor that will protect you from the Wither and Burn effects.&nbsp;The Igniter are traps that burn entities that pass over them and give them a Burn effect that randomly inflicts fire damage</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671438836891708/image.png\" />These are not the only traps found in this dungeon. The Pusher are blocks that push the entities present on the upper surface. This includes mobs and items, so you can use it to transport items over a long distance or to create automated farms in the nether (where water cannot be placed)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671439109525537/image.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099679784910467102/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>In the Keeping Castle, the environment is quite sterile and there are few species able to survive. There are inanimate statues that can ignite when a player approaches and come to life as a Giddy Blaze. This dungeon contains a boss, the Nether Keeper. By releasing it with a Nether Star on its Altar, it will infect you with a spore effect if you get too close to it. It does a lot of damage and will summon allies when it reaches half its life. Once dead, he will drop an Ancient Fire, this item can be used to smelt item in offhand (when ancient fire right clicked in main hand) and to make the Nether Hammer&nbsp;(It melts ores that it mines).<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099672476482556036/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>This austere dungeon adds a new block, the Spore Vaporizer. It diffuses a cloud of spore in the air and can contaminate mobs that pass through it.&nbsp;These spores can be contained in glass bottle to be sent on other mobs. At the end of the effect of Spore, the mobs will be locked in a cocoon of Nether Wart. Tungsten armor can be infused with it to give the wearer an imunity to the Spore effect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099672476771958895/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>In this dungeon, the rooms are separated by a strange door made of Transient Blocks. These blocks can be activated manually or with redstone to disappear and reappear a few seconds later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099672476985851945/image.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099679785204060231/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>The End Dungeon welcomes one creature, the Propulk, a flying mutated shulker that looks like a drone and can throw Levitation projectile.&nbsp;This strutcure contains a boss, the Shelterer. By releasing it with a Nether Star on its Altar,&nbsp;it will be able to lock itself in an energetic shulker box which makes it invulnerable. The only way to damage the boss is via explosions (TNT, Bed or Shulker Cannon). Once dead, it will drop 4 Void Crystals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671831172100188/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>In the dungeon, you can find several ways to do damage to the boss, like the Obsidian Striker (which allows you to send an explosion 9 blocks higher) and the Shulker Cannon (which allows you to send a tnt where the player is looking). To access the high zone of the structure, the Shruster allows the entity to propel them in the air.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671831419551755/image.png\" /></p>\n<p>In this structure, you can find a new ore, Chorundum. This resource can be used to make tools and armor that will protect you from the Levitation effects.<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671831675416646/image.png\" /></p>\n<div>\n<p>With Void Crystals, you can make Teleporter Block that can be used to save a position with the Teleporter Core, and if a Teleporter Core marked with a position is placed in its GUI, and a player shifts on the Teleporter Block, then it will be teleported to the coordinates marked in the Teleporter Core.</p>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/762198215264305182/1099671831935455242/image.png\" />","published":"2022-05-22T14:41:46.397094Z","updated":"2023-08-19T14:50:27.035321Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":86068,"followers":99,"categories":["adventure","equipment","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["KRpzVTHT","oIm7XvAo","2IottLR9","C9b85FCZ","vgD645b7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BCLngNKp/a3eff10756b000a87296484ed18da8618e0de8ab.png"},"version":{"id":"C9b85FCZ","project_id":"BCLngNKp","author_id":"R5XZitIH","featured":false,"name":"Stalwart Dungeons 1.2.8","version_number":"1.2.8","changelog":"<p>-Change some textures (Spore Vaporizer, Structure spawners, Chorundum Gem)<br />-Decrease mobs reach (Incomplete Wither, Reinforced Blaze)<br />-Fix Transient Block and Spore Vaporizer placing issue<br />-Increase mobs reach (Nether Keeper)<br />-Fix the Transient Blocks crash issue<br />-Fix the Ghast Gun fire placing issue<br />-Decrease Transient blocks sound<br />-Change some textures<br />-Other fixes</p>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-08T20:26:25.102353Z","downloads":5306,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a564e3151f4e245d6e46b6ab83d03ca81eeee545a4e07ad0fbbbd7e7fabe04df6f6b7957fcd316d6a8c3505dc22d2ede79f02544292e11059c335246b275b443","sha1":"a970e7be6a8735306db2b040df60907187346b80"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BCLngNKp/versions/C9b85FCZ/stalwart-dungeons-1.19.2-1.2.8.jar","filename":"stalwart-dungeons-1.19.2-1.2.8.jar","primary":true,"size":1051964,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"yBZMMWdh","user":{"id":"R5XZitIH","username":"furti-two","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/R5XZitIH/icon.gif","bio":"i like french cheese","created":"2022-04-14T18:08:54.301942Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"stalwart-dungeons-1.19.2-1.2.8.jar"},"mods\\createmetallurgy-0.0.1-1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"4b1fdc56b7f77a4835e67153cde994745e8a15cb43dfd748f6296f30353042c2d099dc0f9c6596fcd0608b8094ffd264cfe5eb1d343947ddb620591632663c83","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Soft45xC","slug":"create-metallurgy","project_type":"mod","team":"WCI14Snu","title":"Create: Metallurgy","description":"Create Metallurgy is a Create Mod Addon adding new metallurgy processings.","body":"# Create Metallurgy\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xtFb22g.png\" alt=\"Create Metallurgy Title\" width=\"40%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><br>\n\nCreate Metallurgy is a Create Mod Addon developped by Luc_Creeper74, introducing new way of refining ores or create alloys by melting them using a new raw ore processing system wich can duplicate your ores up to x2.33 *(for now :P)*.

Otherwise, there is no power generation. This change is applied to both small and large waterwheels. \n\nThe mod also modifies Create's Windmill default behavior. It makes it so they check the surrounding area to see if there is enough open space for \"air to circulate.\" It also checks the biome of placement, and by default only allows the Windmills to work inside the Overworld. \n\nThis mod adds no new blocks.\n\nFor the warning tooltips, like shown below for that windmill, use Create's Google.\n\nConfiguration is available for the threshold like for the Hose Pulley in Create.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b>¬†we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b>¬†Also note that¬†<b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

All code is open source and documented. Some of its features include:\n\n### üìö Read the Structure Gel API Documentation Here\n\nFor an open source working example of this api, check out [Dungeons Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeons-plus)\n\nYou can find detailed information on how to develop and use this API by Minecraft version.\n\n**Latest Documentation**\n- [1.16+](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.16)\n\n**Older Documentation**\n- [1.15.2](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.15)\n- [1.14.4](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.14)\n\n## üß™ Latest Features\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWO5BqSd29E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Building Tools\n\n**The Building Tool is a new creative mode only item used to perform various large scale block alterations.**\n\n- It can be found in the Structure Items creative mode tab.\n- Right click the Building Tool in the air to open the GUI. Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## üç° Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## üçÆ Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build. If this structure were loaded into the game, the gel inside would be replaced with air, while the air outside would not be placed.\n\n![house_example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/d825a427e103a45857cc527bd3027f3736bc2eb1.gif)<br>\n\nThe code for this block is designed in a way such that you can easily extend it and hook into its behavior with methods in blocks.IStructureGel, should you need behavior not already implemented.\n\nThis is a core mod that modifies a few internal classes. If you get a crash with this mod that only occurs when mixed with another mod, this may be the cause. Please test before reporting.\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2023-05-21T23:11:08.916649Z","updated":"2024-04-21T03:51:04.989788Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":251361,"followers":39,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rrIuQG5f","YtlOh5ib","n7xrHFAI","hoSPdpVk","sC5VyD3U","Yj94wn7H","bsBVjIWk","bgOjiT8y","pCNl93Ka","DjvKx9sL","p2hBgWM7","Wcqj3c1P","czn0eUba","CrRybArg","WdmDpRR4","FQtCiGpd","l0hKtmBk","xavY0MZc","z95TPh9D"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/80dbc0d2d3acadcfcfc1bfa79488f0d353bac1ea.png"},"version":{"id":"bsBVjIWk","project_id":"T8TGycIQ","author_id":"QlRPeSYG","featured":false,"name":"Structure Gel API v2.7.3","version_number":"2.7.3","changelog":"# Fixes\n- Fixed an issue that could cause a world lockup when creating an entity through a data handler.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T18:57:08.498745Z","downloads":8729,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"bb51b7f6c13ece3dd15f417b2442a9b435841b88","sha512":"3d5a2dcef1f41ad5ae814b9a8bfa692c98814eed0adcb5e030c42437edc3b101052401f511c0f2418877abadebe9640c359735955787db511b1ac84587e45407"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/versions/bsBVjIWk/structure_gel-1.19.2-2.7.3.jar","filename":"structure_gel-1.19.2-2.7.3.jar","primary":true,"size":706623,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"JuGQbIAJ","user":{"id":"QlRPeSYG","username":"SilverDavidMC","name":"Silver_David","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15661705?v=4","bio":"Programmer and artist for Modding Legacy.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n¬†\n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n¬†\n- Custom map markers:¬†\nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n¬†\n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n¬†\n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows).¬†\nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n¬†\n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n# Compatibility\n\nQuark has built-in compatibility for a few mods, including JEI and TerraBlender.\n\nQuark may be incompatible with Optifine. If you are having issues using the two together, please uninstall Optifine and use a Sodium fork instead. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing load crashes on 1.20.1, make sure your other mods are up to date, as any mods with integration from older versions will not function until updated.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2024-05-15T22:25:37.486767Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":473671,"followers":498,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8","aKj03FLO","1d9CRYwK","sLfwgQ44","233kpcpB","a8AI08wJ","2u6IMNar","oTVxvQ9o","4vXzGj8g","85thgL6V","5WSxA94q","mTZKUEO8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"8po5DGR8","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.19.2-3.4-418","version_number":"1.19.2-3.4-418","changelog":"https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/releases/tag/release-1.19.2-3.4-418","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T22:46:30.469397Z","downloads":144156,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"716a0b27b62c8870aceb11ef3c5a44d479d700b14163e6f5e52d3e4d380659e49d07971d4502f68f20fc0477cb5bb94f69abab0ca862b6952d9e58985b7ca953","sha1":"3d4bf7bf166b3f30f74100e91d6760fbd93e660f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/8po5DGR8/Quark-3.4-418.jar","filename":"Quark-3.4-418.jar","primary":true,"size":15024651,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"NvZ9ZhwE","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"nxIuTMRv","username":"GoesBySully","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/nxIuTMRv/f4400aa9bc0120732ae57903fab324e986e726f7.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T12:53:22.188525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"IV1Ji8se","username":"quat","name":"quaternary","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2068021?v=4","bio":"Dragon","created":"2020-12-24T00:27:44.019284Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"2pSgrUlO","username":"IThundxr","name":"IThundxr","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74031881?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-14T19:41:15.163217Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"W53r0fU4","username":"Siuolplex","name":"Siuol","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43890828?v=4","bio":"","created":"2020-11-21T03:51:29.493313Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-17T22:00:54.304528Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6056789,"followers":4932,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"WR6z6MYC","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.1-1.19.2 - Forge ","version_number":"1.6.1","changelog":"## What's Changed\n* Reworked the ray engine to fix corner cases.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")","published":"2021-09-12T18:30:52.613317Z","updated":"2023-10-27T08:19:49.826880Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":436730,"followers":212,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["RcAkwRce","QDfK5kGC","6n1Cz7ld","5aMZMK7v","eUgPCLKt","cNa0vkNj","SPQfFKXA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/iRfIGC1s/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"eUgPCLKt","project_id":"iRfIGC1s","author_id":"fYyU5YhM","featured":true,"name":"Starlight 1.1.1 1.19 (Forge)","version_number":"1.1.1+1.19","changelog":"Forge version: 41.0.35+, MC 1.19","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-17T13:56:15.939644Z","downloads":190032,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3d80b848c966841deeeba70305e38a29b7e3788d","sha512":"679598564accbf0b9adb9bf947fe1c2b4dd9a90a6ce3f5013ab52d5f9411ea9f0c5865c20e94f59c4a02d83b5ab8b9368eb26c13da996960074c9688f8d24f56"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRfIGC1s/versions/1.1.1%2B1.19/starlight-1.1.1%2Bforge.cf5b10b.jar","filename":"starlight-1.1.1+forge.cf5b10b.jar","primary":true,"size":110720,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"st6zzqkJ","user":{"id":"fYyU5YhM","username":"spottedleaf","name":"Spottedleaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6100722?v=4","bio":"Developer of Folia, Starlight & Paper.","created":"2021-08-29T13:50:25.716250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"starlight-1.1.1+forge.cf5b10b.jar"},"mods\\immersive_paintings-0.6.7+1.19.2-forge.jar":{"sha512":"2a116012e95db1185365936912a8991339027b230606793451c3d3ecaf713a88d3987213e347f887cdde1c8c449359ee8e4da0be5518b2741c34fcb9e5ccf5f9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"6txNkua3","slug":"immersive-paintings","project_type":"mod","team":"iYK20x5F","title":"Immersive Paintings","description":"Drag and drop, pixelate and hang up beautiful art.

CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the¬†[Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:54:53.998919Z","updated":"2024-01-08T01:33:06.845232Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":241854,"followers":143,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["e9Hq3hbv","3yzqBh3Y","qmq8DyRI","YXklcDpN","CSAWSThG","FpT1xZyZ","iGVkOHlW","gCz8FYyg","FzbfQajL","HkfL3iGO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/72c932a650b6ca3830a1dd82ee86eb7f05f589ef.png"},"version":{"id":"FzbfQajL","project_id":"z53V2L4P","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Smooth Boot (Reloaded) 0.0.4 for MC 1.19.2","version_number":"mc1.19.2-0.0.4","changelog":"This update uses a specific amount of main worker threads you can change it in the config, while the old updates uses the number of the available threads, resulting in worse performance.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T01:29:14.963301Z","downloads":34883,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"984d301c8e7f64ba85f46d1528917c4d95c5fd28","sha512":"daf937bc1752f4674476e9d3a1f29292b9bea54b41ca8f006d9265a925255404368364dad07c276fdfac27bc86845c87f2e6dea67c13b1df19baaf9f51dec7c5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/versions/FzbfQajL/smoothboot%28reloaded%29-mc1.19.2-0.0.4.jar","filename":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.19.2-0.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":40952,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nBB8t1rq","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.19.2-0.0.4.jar"},"mods\\travelersbackpack-forge-1.19.2-8.2.40.jar":{"sha512":"2837c8beb05ead93e897e3c6edf01628b851e5875be306343d2311f20dfd6568fb188dc6507c3d4ee6f13f111e662ac53dbb485fd94c8bce04b35689ca7601dc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rlloIFEV","slug":"travelersbackpack","project_type":"mod","team":"zu2WNaj0","title":"Traveler's Backpack","description":"Unique and upgradeable backpacks with customisation, Curios API/Trinkets integration and more!","body":"## Traveler's Backpack\n...is a Minecraft mod, which adds unique **backpacks**.

No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about¬†**63 inventory slots**¬†and¬†**2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 7 buckets of fluid or even 28 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer**¬†to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be¬†**upgraded**¬†to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a¬†**smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset backpack upgrades and settings, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios/Trinkets integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nCrafting Table is your bestfriend? Equip your backpack with Crafting Upgrade! Unroll the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8wR8Thg.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/c9Ojonb.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fmjcSej.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/np93li4.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

In this situation there will always be 6 axis ant 15 buttons which should be roughly the same on all gamepads (note that on some gamepads the A/B-X/Y buttons are inverted, and the two back trigger axis can just be shoulder buttons)  \n  \nAny joystick/gamepad can work with the mod, as long as it is detected by GLFW.\nHowever, you will need to enable advanced input mode for that. Please check [the wiki](https://github.com/getItemFromBlock/Create-Tweaked-Controllers/wiki) for more infos.  \n\nHere is a list of supported devices:  \n- Keyboard  \n- Mouse buttons  \n- Mouse cursor movements  \n- Official gamepads such as Xbox controllers or Playstation DualShock are supported  \n- Knockoff/alternate gamepads (like a Logitech controller) should work  \n- Joysticks/hotas/racing wheels and other devices should be supported, but I have been proven wrong multiple times already, so if it does not you can still try a gamepad/xbox controller emulator.  \n- WiiMotes are (sadly) not supported  \n\n## Remarks\n\nDue to a Create limitation, if a network is updated too many times it will break. This can happen if you connect an axis output to an Adjustable Chain Gearshift, for example. This behavior is now disabled by the mod since version 1.2.3.  \n\nThe joystick axis are directly read from GLFW. With most if not all gamepads, the +X axis points to the right, and the +Y axis points down.\n\nIF YOU USE A NINTENDO CONTROLLER, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS: [https://github.com/getItemFromBlock/Create-Tweaked-Controllers/issues/1](https://github.com/getItemFromBlock/Create-Tweaked-Controllers/issues/1).","published":"2023-09-14T13:18:34.967122Z","updated":"2024-03-23T23:42:39.935607Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":66208,"followers":42,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["oO8PjIHW","6EP5kW8g","MiuLNoH9","YVjfDAii","71kiWmZf","G0tdbG94","TOn94FCk","ss0fJNyz","Sdcs8mzq","5VVJNYv7","f6pj28vt","UAbUIQOp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H6bJ8Ju4/2805055603520f41014670a32d9fe74cd22ea008.png"},"version":{"id":"f6pj28vt","project_id":"H6bJ8Ju4","author_id":"qgEE7b3D","featured":false,"name":"1.19.2 Version 1.2.4","version_number":"1.19.2-1.2.4","changelog":"# Tally update\n  \n## Changed\n- Applied the new mouse cursor input hook from 1.20 branch, fixes #11 \n- Changed default keyboard layout to not use right mouse click, allowing more easily to exit the controller\n- Added a mixin to disable Create's tally system:\n  - The tally system is what is causing a mechanical network to break when updated too much\n  - You can now do as many update to a network without anything breaking\n  - This is effective on all networks, not only the ones updated by a tweaked controller","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-23T23:40:20.468342Z","downloads":876,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1206367ffd6ffc3c55d68da34b35ae9635f37d20","sha512":"cbcbc63a831a78c2a2f3d15637bd3edeb4d17f24af7b66b2622233cd28a1bb0a3bfde0ad133cd0c53bf68dac8137c7199d4fdbe37aa3e7bb2d80c63653f04826"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/H6bJ8Ju4/versions/f6pj28vt/create_tweaked_controllers-1.19.2-1.2.4.jar","filename":"create_tweaked_controllers-1.19.2-1.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":296988,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gu7yAYhd","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"u6dRKJwZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HIQQROBW","user":{"id":"qgEE7b3D","username":"getItemFromBlock","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/qgEE7b3D/7d67697649d7e7d8447c8349055c1cb35604cfd4.jpg","bio":null,"created":"2023-09-14T13:09:55.319186Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"create_tweaked_controllers-1.19.2-1.2.4.jar"},"mods\\EMI Create Schematics [1.0.0 forge1.19.2].jar":{"sha512":"8bd3fec0aa422486a103a5644f3b4c29773a122362480266a16bcfe491ae99cfd602d71f7c242804908f6e348a06ee6bb9d97d7c3e816377977b5aebf87bd804","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5bgqgixq","slug":"emi-create-schematics","project_type":"mod","team":"K2aQQsVK","title":"EMI: Create Schematics","description":"Add schematic items to EMI Favourites list","body":"![Image not loading?

All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack.

To resolve this issue, you'll need to perform a block update on affected bridges or stairs. Here's how:\n\nPlace any block above/next to the affected bridge or stairs, or break and replace the affected bridge or stairs, which will trigger an update for neighboring bridges.\n\nWe highly recommend creating backups of your existing game worlds before applying this update.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nPerformance:\n- Made many changes, to reduce the memory usage as much as I could, lowered memory usage by 80-90%.\n- Refactored code to be more efficient and optimized\n- Lowered the count of all blockstates by 85 - 89 % \n  ( From 13920 to 1516 )\n- Removed lots of model.jsons and made them more efficient\n\n\nAdded :\n- Stone Bridges, Stairs, Piers have new variations \n  ( nether bricks, mossy cobblestone, cobblestone, end stone bricks,\n   prismarine bricks, andesite, granite, diorite )\n- New Balustrade Stone Bridges ( 17 variations )\n- Red Asian Bridge, Support, Stairs\n- Glass Bridge, Support, Stairs\n\n\nBridge Torch & Lantern:\n- Can be placed on bridge/bridge stairs railings ( They have a tooltip )\n- Cannot be placed in the middle\n- They break if there is no solid block below them\n\n\nBridge Piers:\n- Can now be waterlogged (again!..)\n- Have a new model\n\n\nChanges:\n- Most bridges have an improved model\n- All Bridges have now the same height (base/railings), this change fixes the no step sounds whilst walking on a bridge\n- Removed Torches in bridges, made separate torches which can be placed on bridge/bridge stair railing ( to prevent doubling the states because of this..)\n- Rope Bridges have only 2 facing sides, north and east. Since west and south would be the same as north and east, we decided to merge it so it wont create redundant blockstates\n- Bridge handrails/handguards have been reworked, you can now toggle between all 4 sides or empty platform, with this change you can modify bridges like never before\n- Bridges have an updated placing mechanism, if you place a bridge while on a bridge, it will place down a bridge in the way you are facing ( Similar to the scaffolding )\n- Bridge Stairs have also an updated placing mechanism, if you place the stair on the stair, it will build another stair one block behind and above it, this way you can easily build bridge stairs upwards.\n- Shears can be used like pliers\n- Bridges now have a tooltip about Pliers/Shears\n- Bridges and Stairs cannot be placed directly above themselves, this makes it easier to build\n- Bridge Piers/Supports no longer connect but they have an improved model to make them look just as good as before\n- All Stone recipes can now be crafted in the stonecutter too\n- Bridges now have the tag Trapdoors, this is because entities are pathfinding it when it has the tag...\n\n\nNew Translations:\nfr_fr by Calvineries\nko_kr by spinodal23\nuk_ua by Moonvvell\nes_cl by Ganbare-Lucifer\n\n\nUpdated Translations:\nru_ru by mindryder\nde_de by PatrickK01\nes_es by Divinium115\n\n\nIssues Fixed:\n- Bridges have no step sound\n- Wrong breaking sounds on a few blocks\n- Wrong hardness on some blocks\n- Bridge Piers/Supports cannot be waterlogged\n- Two Wide Bridges don't connect to stairs\n- Stone and Log Bridges have wrong texture for bottom\n- Wrong texture UV size on some stairs\n- Iron Bridge can be used as fuel\n- Bridge stairs alignment is weird\n- Z-fighting on some bridges and stairs\n- Pliers do not appear in creative menu or JEI\n- Pliers unable to make a bridge fully open\n- Bamboo and Dry Bamboo Bridges and Stairs do not fully\n  connect\n- Missing mcw tags from some blocks\n- Mobs Pathfinding get stuck on bridge ( They now walk correctly on the base bridge, but when there is a block with handrail they will jump-move, but they are now pathfinding bridges )\n- Bridge Support is not a full block\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-06T14:40:35.203867Z","downloads":1498,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ff6b41f34c9debde7a7b4053d3c49b126c203029ddc20f23c5411631df7673abdaa0ec8a5137133c02140402dcb81c4bc1d442697fd1dac00bddc764883ee32a","sha1":"070b61d199e1062caa2c619361bae2f9394add3d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GURcjz8O/versions/WoCEg3Ld/mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.19.2forge.jar","filename":"mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.19.2forge.jar","primary":true,"size":652265,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"w0R55u0J","user":{"id":"HTw9s4lh","username":"sketchmacaw","name":"Sketch Macaw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60577275?v=4","bio":"Welcome to my profile!

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

Guardian Beam Defense","description":"Addon for Create that adds in sophisticated laser defense systems","body":"Requires the [Create Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) to properly work.\n\n¬†\n\nCreate Guardian Beam Defense is a mini mod / addon for Create that adds in stationary laser defense units themed around Guardians and Ocean Monuments that are capable of automatically locking on to specified mobs and damaging them over time in frequent bursts.\n\n¬†\n\n--There are currently two primary types of such laser defense units--\n\n¬†\n\n**Basic Guardian Beam Turret**: The basic variant of the guardian beam turrets that is capable of locking on to a single hostile mob should it come within 17 blocks from the turret. Craftable using a new drop from Guardians when killed by a player.\n\n¬†\n\n**Advanced Guardian Beam Turret**:¬†An upgraded version of the guardian beam turret that is capable of targeting 10 different hostiles at a given time within a 17 block radius. Craftable using a new drop from Elder Guardians when killed by a player.\n\n¬†\n\n--Other Gadgets--\n\n¬†\n\n**Beam Reactor Helmet**: A helmet that doubles down as an armor piece slightly better than netherite as well as a fairly powerful weapon that is capable of firing a continuous guardian beam that can damage multiple enemies that are caught in the path of the laser at the cost of the helmet's durability (activated using the 'R' key by default).\n\n¬†\n\n--Additional Notes--\n\n¬†\n\n- The turrets' beam charge up time depends on the rotation speed of the source powering the module, meaning that slower RPMs cause longer laser charge up times whilst faster RPMs result in faster attack sequences.\n\n- The turrets require a constant line of sight towards their targets in order to successfully lock on and damage them.\n\n- The turrets take a very long time to break with a pickaxe; to properly deploy / move them use a wrench.\n\n- As of 1.2.0b, turrets are now able to be owned by players and support multiple entity targeting options, including other players. Moreover, other players aren't able to pick up turrets that are owned by someone else (unless they were placed before 1.2.0b) as well as change the targeting options.\n\n¬†\n\n- This mod is currently in early access / beta with the potential of new features and improvements being added in the future","published":"2023-08-24T15:41:10.164282Z","updated":"2024-01-28T05:52:19.852285Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":13231,"followers":18,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["RYSRb6ML","ZWLuTfp4","o3LtzCy4","1SHlpVZa","EhjxdFJ8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pwPEdvXO/1447ab21d5eba1581ec5ead3baadcaf6196a95da.png"},"version":{"id":"1SHlpVZa","project_id":"pwPEdvXO","author_id":"VGbwvvH3","featured":false,"name":"Create Guardian Beam Defense 1.2.3b-1.19.2","version_number":"1.2.3b","changelog":"Ver. 1.2.3b (1.19.2 version from CurseForge)\n\n- Slightly buffed the beam reactor helmet's laser damage from 6 to 8 to match the elder guardian's stats (4 hearts (2 player damage and 2 magic damage))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-07T14:29:27.484553Z","downloads":1380,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"0708419bc5c93c86c9ad20ebeb0089c9efecfa1a","sha512":"b7993af125b1cc36869602a7a84a6f09b6583b6dfc3d84dfd77b2a59ae451f59d68202ead226705a4c81aeaae96803da235586957141e6277479a739d5457cf7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/pwPEdvXO/versions/1SHlpVZa/Create-Guardian-Beam-Defense-1.2.3b.jar","filename":"Create-Guardian-Beam-Defense-1.2.3b.jar","primary":true,"size":134246,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DHQ3e6cM","user":{"id":"VGbwvvH3","username":"ibarnstormer","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48729319?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-06-07T21:00:05.006403Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Create-Guardian-Beam-Defense-1.2.3b.jar"},"mods\\dungeons_plus-1.19.2-1.3.1.jar":{"sha512":"a984db393ca11bfdb958a4927a49b1df576c839578f664268f4fb7f807f14865422f0b98e979e1131c62f5e5c3e51fac72fa64ef621795c723117d468a742a6e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5fNJnSba","slug":"dungeons-plus","project_type":"mod","team":"cuwkuzMa","title":"Dungeons Plus","description":"A mod that adds some simple Vanilla+ styled dungeons, while showcasing the Structure Gel API.","body":"![](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/481666164867068300-Dungeons-Plus-Banner.png)\n\n<center>\n\n## Dungeons Plus\n\n</center>\n\n<!-- Shields Start -->\n\n<center>\n\n[![Modding Legacy Build Server](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/build/https/builds.moddinglegacy.com/view/Developers/job/Modding-Legacy/job/dungeons-plus/job/1.19.x.svg?logo=jenkins&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge)](https://builds.moddinglegacy.com/view/Developers/job/Modding-Legacy/job/dungeons-plus)\n[![Modding Legacy Discord Server](https://img.shields.io/discord/223938153260515328.svg?color=7289DA&label=discord&logo=discord&logoColor=FFFFFF&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/tDBjHWy)\n[![Contribute to Dungeons Plus by helping break the language barrier by translating!](https://img.shields.io/badge/translate-onesky-9cf?style=for-the-badge&logo=json \"Contribute to Dungeons Plus by helping break the language barrier by translating!\")](https://moddinglegacy.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project/364485)\n[![Please consider supporting us on Patreon!](https://img.shields.io/badge/patreon-donate-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=patreon \"If you like what we do, consider supporting us on Patreon!

All code is open source and documented.\n\n# ‚õ∫ Summary\n\nDungeons Plus adds 7 new dungeons to the game with maps to guide you on a journey between them.\n\n**üß™ Latest Updates**\n\n\n# ‚öîÔ∏è Dungeons\n\n![Dungeons](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/817465634292533874-all-dungeons.png)\n\n### Tower\n\nThese towers have four floors with monster spawners and loot. The first three floors are randomized and can be zombie, spider, or skeleton rooms. The fourth floor is a vex room. Inside this tower, you can find a map that will lead you to the buried dungeon. Generates in either plains, forests, roofed forests, birch forests, and mountains.\n\n### Reanimated Ruins\n\nFound underground, this labyrinth of rooms will lead you to either the Snowy Temple, Leviathan, or Warped Garden depending on what variant of this structure you find.\n\n### Leviathan\n\nThis ancient skeleton can be found in deserts and hides a secret beneath. Explore the ancient temple and find the treasures that rest within. Legend has it that this is where the Leviathan Blade resides. Along with treasure, the husks that spawn here are capable of dropping sand with their normal loot.\n\n### Snowy Temple\n\nThis abandoned temple of old has long since been taken over by Strays. At the top, you‚Äôll find the Frosted Cowl to aid you in your combat. Strays spawned within this structure can drop ice, or rarely packed ice, on death, and they‚Äôre the only mob allowed to spawn inside{: style=‚Äùfont-size: 1.2em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;‚Äù}\n\n### Warped Garden\n\nThis shell of an undersea town is home to many axe-wielding drowned and provides a renewable source of coral blocks. Weapons from a time forgotten, such as the Warped Axe, can still be found inside.\n\n### End Ruins\n\nOnce you defeat the dragon and gain access to the outer islands, you may be lucky enough to find this dilapidated structure. There isn‚Äôt much loot inside, but at the top of the tower, you can find a dragon egg. Be careful though, the endermen inside aren‚Äôt quite as peaceful as the ones outside of the structure.\n\n### Soul Prison\n\nFound in the lava pools of the Nether‚Äôs soul sand valley, you may find this prison of souls. With the amount of ghasts surrounding it, approaching and reaching the top for your reward may prove to be a no small task. Be wary as the ghasts are not opposed to destroying the structure around you with their fireballs. Should you survive, you may walk out with a Soul Cannon.\n\n\nüåê Translate Dungeons Plus - help break the language barrier!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll translators are credited here that have translated the mod to their native languages.

It also adds boss music, to add that final boss feel. The Ender Dragon even has a second phase when she reaches half health!\n\nPlus, instead of a wimpy 200 health, the Ender Dragon now has 500 health, making it a lot harder.\n\nLet the fight begin.\n\nIf you want to make the music quieter, it is the \"Jukebox/Note Blocks\" slider in Music and Sounds.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Recommended Mods</summary>\n\n### These mods are pretty good when used together with EDFR.

When she becomes Mad, she will respawn 3 end crystals and be able to use Mad attacks. She can only become Mad once, even if her health goes above half again.\n\nMad attacks (only used after the dragon reaches half health):\n\n4. Teleport to random end crystal location.\n5. Strike lightning on everyone (if you are moving, the lightning will appear where you were a second ago.)\n6. Summon anvils 20 blocks above everyone (more visual flare planned)\n7. Spawns miniboss (only one miniboss can exist at once, and only one miniboss can be spawned per fight, and the dragon will no longer move while miniboss is in existence, so you have to kill the miniboss)\n\nThe attacks are subject to change as I plan on adding more and changing some.\n</details>\n\n## Need to contact me?\n[![Chat with us on Discord!](https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frawcdn.githack.com%2Fintergrav%2Fdevins-badges%2F1aec26abb75544baec37249f42008b2fcc0e731f%2Fassets%2Fcozy%2Fsocial%2Fdiscord-plural_64h.png%3Fraw%3Dtrue&n=-1)](https://discord.gg/DZYmPudUP4)\n\nThis datapack is supposed to make the battle feel more epic.\n\nWant to suggest an attack?

The Estrogen Effect gives you an effect\nallowing you to **Dash** (With some hidden abilities too)!\n\nTo Dash, simply have the Estrogen Pill effect (Called Girl Power in game) and click [X], if that does not work, you may\nneed to rebind the key in the Minecraft control settings or rebind any key that uses the same key. Then it should be\nsmooth dashin' from there!\n\nThis mod also features a [complete soundtrack](https://erora.bandcamp.com/album/create-estrogen) that automatically plays while you have the Girl Power effect. \nTo hear it, make sure you have your music sound category turned up!\n\n### `Additional Features`\n\nThis mod adds a lot of other features related to Estrogen and its production. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n- a new block called the Centrifuge, with a new mechanic for fluid processing which is used to make the Estrogen fluid.\n  üåÄ <br>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cqXBcVw.png\" alt=\"centrifuge\" width=\"256\"/>\n- Estrogen Patches with their own slots, allowing you to have the Estrogen Effect active for long amounts of time. ü©π<br>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QfI4vWJ.png\" alt=\"patches\" width=\"256\"/>\n- Some custom mechanics you may discover when dashing around! üí®<br>\n  <img src=\"https://static.miraheze.org/celestewiki/thumb/6/67/Wavedashing.gif/240px-Wavedashing.gif\" alt=\"dashing\" width=\"256\"/>\n- New Model Features for the player when Estrogen effect is active üëÄ<br>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MFRFoFN.png\" alt=\"me :3\" width=\"256\"/>\n- A new type of cookie A new type of [(musical?)](https://erora.bandcamp.com/track/g03c) cookie üòã üç™<br>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lrPWwPT.png\" alt=\"Estrogen Chip Cookie\" width=\"256\"/>\n- And many more (including some easter eggs)! ü•ö<br>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mkVcXQA.png\" alt=\":3\" width=\"256\"/>\n\n### `Extra information`\n\nThis mod is still in development, so expect some bugs and missing features.

During each tick, the client will do some vector math to calculate lightmaps for blocks and the sky, then upload that new texture to the GPU. However, this can be completely avoided and cached if nothing affecting brightness is changed. This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Sky color calculation optimizations**<p>\n  Minecraft uses `CubicScampler.sampleColor` every frame to calculate the current sky color. This function loops 216 times to factor in surrounding biomes-even if all surrounding biomes are identical or have identical sky colors. This mod makes this function only get called if you are between biomes with different sky colors and only makes it get called every tick. Otherwise, a shorter, simpler and faster sky color calculation is used.\n- **Don't do debug logic if we don't need to**<p>\n  Minecraft has four debug renderers that can be activated with a debug server: bees, game events, game test and villager AI. Even if there's nothing to process, the logic for these debug renderers are still executed. This mod will only execute them if debug is enabled and there is data to process.\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\nYou can disable any optimization in the config file if you need to.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*","published":"2023-12-03T23:38:30.615171Z","updated":"2024-04-27T02:45:11.246442Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":609866,"followers":336,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4iRxgKYG","7EtZn21b","LvWnmLrW","CMQm449N","QPNT0tat","ww747oVi","R5epQB48","7mkIryQX","N83O7mRY","tPcndzIs","Rya4Prxg","P1VV7yAB","osrW6S8S","5iiizW8v","NPtJUzCQ","xrCxVWjv","csMggyw8","pYctvKKH","ByJJBuGh","frxUrBuZ","f80P5Er3","ajq5p3Cr","lVUqygYP","6qzarF6r","py5wZc1k","9vTW5SzW","ouYuE0eo","RppoOA91","o0gYJCDi","x9zMt7t7","Tyi2q14M","QFKaP0NG","PY8WFC19","YPx40hkR","WZB4pQ3u","l5RWBdez","yK1K2DcH","pNkHByNm","tfPcVhXP","NepFM2XR","74fRkfKB","PXrqBQZG","O6GYJnvX","vJEBno3y","84AEMPgv","DkQi3drk","KWwNfrjN","wlqlZ5hE","37M8Rd4S","KeVurIPw","8JJc3kIM","r88RTaW8","Go4FoZir","dAVlOLS6","cpFHy43X","bOuSwVyc","aKkny43Y","918aozAU","zLWPzGCh","Gsub2Uuo","ydYsXrGL","eT6Jsaq5","zZYSuJ5b","bpmrr094"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"zLWPzGCh","project_id":"g96Z4WVZ","author_id":"MtdsrsRk","featured":true,"name":"2.1.1 (1.19.1/1.19.2)","version_number":"2.1.1","changelog":"**This is the final supported release for 1.19.3/1.19.4!

It will also work in singleplayers worlds, but it's designed to bring an economy throughout a server's lifetime.

These missions can be vanilla missions like \"Break X Veridium\" or Create mod related like \"Drive a train for 4 km with at least 2 passengers\". You can also reroll the missions, and claim prices by completing them.\n**Open the mission GUI pressing H key (by default) or using `/missions` command**\n\n# Mission types:\nAs time goes on, more missions will be added. Some missions can have lots of variation like breaking a block, while others are simpler like walking.\n\nThere are in total 16 Mission Types that use Create-related mechanics.\n\ncut, compact, sail, craft, ride, harvester, train-driver-passenger, crush, eat, train-passenger, place, dive, press, mix, train-driver, break, saw, kill, drill, drink, mill, minecart, fly, relocate, fish, walk, swim, feed, belt-walk\n\n# Special thanks to:\n- TheLegendofSaram, Mexican translation\n- __Tesseract, French translation\n- MrRedRhino, German translation\n- –≥–ª–µ–±–∏–∫—Å, Russian translation\n- Starlotte, mission complete sound\n- [Seboso](https://www.fiverr.com/seboso557), Jar of Tips texture\n\n## Needed for server owners\n<details>\n<summary>Spoilers</summary>\n\nSelect the currencies and their exchange in `config\\missions\\currency.json`\n\nAs an example with [Create: Numismatics](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-numismatics) it would look like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"numismatics:spur\": \"8\"},\n  {\"numismatics:bevel\": \"2\"},\n  {\"numismatics:sprocket\": \"4\"},\n  {\"numismatics:cog\": \"8\"},\n  {\"numismatics:crown\": \"8\"},\n  {\"numismatics:sun\": \"1\"}\n]\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>missions.json -> How to configure the missions? </summary>\nThis file can be found in `config\\missions\\missions.json`.\nAn example mission configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"place\": {\n    \"reward\": {\n      \"amount\": \"2-23\",\n      \"item\": \"numismatics:bevel\"\n    },\n    \"weight\": 0.7,\n    \"missions\": {\n      \"create:track_signal\": \"20-50\",\n      \"#minecraft:logs\": \"20-50\"\n    },\n    \"titles\": [\n      \"Example title\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRanges like 2-23 mean a number at random from 2 to 23, both included.\nMission example: Place 35 Acacia Log(s)\nReward example: 2-23 Iron Coin(s)\n\nAction number is determined when you RECEIVE the mission, and rewards are determined when you COMPLETE the mission.\n\nThe \"weight\" is the chance of this mission to be selected.

Players must obtain telefluid in order to power their teleporters, and must carefully manage their supply to ensure their teleporters remain operational.\n\n \n\nOne of the standout features of Create Teleporters is the inclusion of a custom portal that can teleport players to any location in any dimension. This feature adds a new level of exploration and discovery to the game, allowing players to easily travel to new and exciting locations.\n\n \n\nFinally, the mod includes a pocket dimension remote that sends players to a small room in a custom dimension.

brass you are able to upgrade your copper backtank to a jetpack, \nusing the pressurized air inside to propel yourself through the air.\n\nInspired by [Simply Jetpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-jetpacks-2),\nthis jetpack also has a hover mode.\n\nLike the copper backtank, the jetpack does also go in the chest slot, \nfeeds air to items like the extendo-grip and can be enchanted with _Capacity_.\nJust like the backtank it is charged by placing it down and supplying it with rotational force.\n\n![Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/usage.png)\n\nWhen underwater while sprint-swimming, the jetpack boosts your swimming speed.\nAdditionally, the hover-mode prevents you from floating downwards.\n\n![Underwater Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/underwater.png)\n\nIf a mod similar to [Elytra Slot](https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/elytraslot), \nwhich enables equipping an elytra in addition to a chestplate, \nthe jetpack will instead give you firework-like boost while the player is pressing the `UP`-key.\n\n![Elytra Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/elytra.png)\n\nCurios Support is possible by adding it via a datapack. Save to following to `data/curios/tags/items/back.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"replace\": false,\n  \"values\": [\n    \"create_jetpack:jetpack\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAn example datapack enabling this support can be downloaded

It brings many new features, and optimizes for the user experience. Outside of the standard Fabric/Quilt API, EMI requires **zero** dependencies, and can be launched with the game simply and easily.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/0d3b5b33d0016b21834ce6f3602169f7c48de13f.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/f3c8b452eae6dde028c37e3a3e3792459468d865.png)\n\n## Runtime JEI Compat\nFor runtime JEI compat, all you need to do is install JEI alongside EMI and they will work together to share recipes. JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

Each scroll contains a spell, similar to an enchanted book. The scroll can be consumed to cast that spell without consuming mana or triggering a cooldown, or brought to the first new workstation added: the Inscription Table. At the inscription table, you are allowed to place a spell book, one either found or crafted, and slot the scroll into it. However, depending on the rarity of the scroll (determined by the spell's level), it may be too powerful for your spell book. In this case, you must go forth on a journey to obtain a better spell book.\n</p>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/inscription_table.png)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Materials</summary>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/materials.png)\n\nThere are many materials you may stumble upon throughout your adventures in the Overworld and Nether, including:\n\n#### <u>Ink</u>\n\nInk can be found in magic structures, such as wizard towers, and is the key to crafting scrolls. There are 5 variants, one for each rarity of scroll. When using ink in the Scroll Forge, it will allow you to craft a spell of the corresponding rarity, at the lowest level available. If the minimum rarity of a spell is higher than the ink provided, you will not be able to craft it at all, instead needing a higher quality ink to craft its first level.\n\n#### <u>Focuses</u>\n- There are 9 schools of magic, and you require a magical focus to craft scrolls or gear pertaining to that school. The schools and their focus are:\n- Fire - Blaze Rods (Vanilla)\n- Ice - Frozen Bones (Dropped from Strays)\n- Lightning - Bottles o' Lightning - (Use empty bottle on charged creeper)\n- Holy - Divine Pearls (Crafted from gold and amethyst)\n- Blood - Blood Vials (Obtained by cooking mobs in a cauldron; put them (or yourself) into a cauldron with a lit campfire beneath them)\n- Ender - Ender Pearls (Vanilla)\n- Evocation - Emeralds (Vanilla)\n- Void - Echo Shards (Vanilla)\n- Poison - Poisonous Potatoes (Vanilla, with additional recipe)\n\n#### <u>Arcane Essence</u>\n\nArcane essence is the most common and most important magical material. It can be found in magical structures, or looted from killing magical enemies. Low amounts of it may craft weak magic items, but its primary purpose is to be condensed into Arcane Cloth or Arcane Ingots, and used in more powerful crafting recipes.\n\n\n#### <u>Runestones</u>\n\nRunestones are a more rare find in magical structures, and are always found as blank runestones. Using 8 focuses, you can craft a runestone to a specific school, and use your inscribed runestone to craft gear related to that school.\n\n\n#### <u>Other</u>\n\nHogskin - a new drop from hoglins, and is used to craft magical items\nCinder Essence - a drop from Ancient Knights (who can be summoned at ancient battleground) and is used to craft upgrade orbs\nArcane Debris/Arcane Salvage - an ore similar to ancient debris, but is found in the Overworld. A netherite pickaxe is required to harvest it, and the scrap is used in powerful magical recipes.\nRuined Book - a sculk-infested book that can be found in ancient cities, used for crafting powerful spell books\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Crafting Stations</summary>\n\n<p>\nAll of your magical tinkering will be done at the Inscription Table, Scroll Forge, and Arcane Anvil. (See getting started for Inscription Table)\n</p>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/tristation.png)\n\n#### Scroll Forge\n\n<p>\nThe Scroll Forge is a new crafting station that allows the player to craft scrolls by using ink, paper, and a focus. The ink determines the rarity/level, and the focus determines what school of spells you can craft.\n</p>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/scroll_forge.png)\n\n#### Arcane Anvil\n\n<p>\nThe Arcane Anvil is a new crafting station that is used to combine magic items together, such as:\n\n- Upgrading scrolls (just like enchanted books)\n- Upgrade school armor and Spell Books using upgrade orbs\n- Imbue swords with a spell (only one at a time, scrolls cannot be retrieved after imbuing them. Imbuements can be removed with shriving stones)\n</p>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/arcane_anvil.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Equipment</summary>\n\n<p>\nMany new pieces of magical equipment can be found, looted, or crafted in this mod.\n\nSome of these include 6 craftable spell books that follow vanilla progression (iron, diamond, netherite, and so on), 2 Unique spell books that are rare drops from certain mobs and come with pre-slotted spells, and 3 additional spell books that can be found throughout the world.\n</p>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/equipment.png)\n\n<p>\nAdditionally, 10 sets of armor are added to the game, including an early game, mid game, and 8 late game sets, each corresponding to a school of magic, giving players additional power for that school while they wear them.\n</p>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/armor.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>World Gen</summary>\n\n<p>\nSeveral new randomly generated structures can be found in your new magical world. They'll contain magical loot - and magical enemies guarding it - as well as traps, and most importantly: secret treasure. *As a side note, it is not required to break any blocks to find secrets.\n</p>\n\n#### Structure Info\n\n<u>Mountain Tower (Bottom Left)</u>\n\nThe lonely tower of ice mages, it can be found in mountainous and snowy biomes\n\n<u>Mangrove Hut (Top Middle)</u>\n\nHome of the fire mages, it can be found in swampy biomes\n\n<u>Evoker Fort (Bottom Right)</u>\n\nKeep of the Archevoker, it can be found in forests, plains, deserts, and savannas\nRandomly generated surrounding camp\n\n<u>The Catacombs (Top Right)</u>\n\nThe first randomly generated dungeon and boss fight of the mod, it is the magical stronghold of a king who died long ago and can be found deep underground\nWayward Compass can be used to locate them\nIt is recommended to have enchanted diamond gear to take on the Dead King boss \n\n<u>Ancient Battlegrounds (Top Left)</u>\n\nThe site of a battle of which the name was long ago forgotten, it can be found resurfacing in the Nether\nArmor Piles can be harvested to reanimate Ancient Knights\nDebris may be denser in the areas around them\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/structures.png)\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/magic_loot.png)\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/ancient_city_loot.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Compatibility</summary>\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/apotheosis.png)\n\n![Picture](https://iron431.github.io/Irons-Spellbooks-Docs/img/screenshots/tetra.png)\n\n</details>\n","published":"2023-05-07T16:51:17.271987Z","updated":"2024-04-26T19:01:13.657735Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":132666,"followers":330,"categories":["adventure","equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","mobs"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AnHXUuLL","kKaesIoI","4exdsSoN","MfvyteHV","OpV6N6a3","hpcuIu4g","EhvXZOsI","f8mz7pmJ","ySXFDJ1I","NK9zQZ4h","PCgC4yrt","qkN5fpMc","Zm0S12nr","vrVyUVot","TJVgrTUZ","eCA1X6b0","N1fJJE3r","Q9mGU6DQ","61URWOvE","ySlhvuzS","o59Bw0yT","NrxK8xqM","ZjoyUemh","UqWMcbiF","pe2avlsH","wGsQZ6ix","ZRSm1rxa","bLSKfWxv","dh8hxGbr","LPJkODSN","tBPmwNuN"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s4OWxYQQ/6a1f5c6adb434a6c56c1975af6f4fbde3ba907ff.png"},"version":{"id":"LPJkODSN","project_id":"s4OWxYQQ","author_id":"aeXCUa9J","featured":false,"name":"Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks 1.19.2-3.1.4","version_number":"1.19.2-3.1.4","changelog":"[https://iron.wiki/changelog/](https://iron.wiki/changelog/)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-26T19:00:29.135927Z","downloads":2633,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e93de2a1de14d435ecf5e3b2ac34d85906ea00ce","sha512":"4cd10fc28e1c178f2d1633e0af7b9a608f79354e86b9659ca9599f6fe0bf20a6866afc3c3645fb74ca81ce1249440e71dcf187cb3f180c7e5faa67d02022912b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s4OWxYQQ/versions/LPJkODSN/irons_spellbooks-1.19.2-3.1.4.jar","filename":"irons_spellbooks-1.19.2-3.1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":8443417,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"40FYwb4z","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"vvuO3ImH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Xd22h5Rp","user":{"id":"LJAA9rMP","username":"lab3","name":"Len Bucchino","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1099358?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-05-07T00:21:33.872653Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"Xd22h5Rp","user":{"id":"aeXCUa9J","username":"iron431","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/aeXCUa9J/1909a0f9473f880f4f9b8d7cf370daf582ca1f7a.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-05-07T16:50:23.688771Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"irons_spellbooks-1.19.2-3.1.4.jar"},"mods\\XaeroPlus-2.11+forge-1.19.2-WM1.38.4-MM24.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"fef8fcfcc859e521d84d0c4e84304cf3c5bf0ca8ba086cdfe82429f967a2af72b49280dc088279159ff675d4dc4777cb409e26184b8eb72557a4321cc2335a3f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EnPUzSTg","slug":"xaeroplus","project_type":"mod","team":"CcUv6rNN","title":"XaeroPlus","description":"Xaero WorldMap / Minimap Extra Features","body":"# XaeroPlus\n\nXaeroPlus is a client-side Minecraft mod that depends on and modifies the Xaero's WorldMap and Minimap mods with extra\nfeatures and performance improvements -

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

height=\"48\">\n<p> </p>\n<img src=https://i.imgur.com/9Ni5XhG.png width=\"836\" height=\"503\">\n<p> </p>\n<p> The Graveyard adds new spooky biomes, structures, mobs and blocks to make your minecraft adventure more thrilling and challenging. </br>\nEvery structure, mob and biome was built with a lot of attention to detail to create an immersive experience for you. </p>\n\n<h2> Structures </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Haunted House: uncover the secrets of this run down house.</li>\n<li>Small Grave: a final resting place encountered frequently while exploring.</li>\n<li>Small Graveyard: a cemetery that comes in multiple variants.</li>\n<li>Medium Graveyard: a quite large cemetery in the woods surrounding a minecraft temple. It holds a lot to explore and to gather, but nothing comes without a risk. Especially at night.</li>\n<li>Mushroom Grave: an overgrown grave, spawning in swamps, jungles and mushroom islands.</li>\n<li>Memorial Birch Tree: an imposing tree found in birch forests.</li>\n<li>Large Graveyard: an immense jigsaw structure generating in forests. But be warned - it is full of dangers.</li>\n<li>Crypt: an expansive labyrinth, full of traps, loot and dangers, hidden in the depths.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Boss - Corrupted Champion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Corrupted Champion is the entombed remnant of an unknown hero, fallen into corruption. Its power arise from its bone staff, which was crafted from the bones of its innocent victims. With its power, the lich can controll the minds of its enemies and turn peaceful beings into abominations fighting along its side. But beware. Even if you manage to drain the staff's corruption, the fight isn't over.</li>\n\n \n<li>Phases:</li>\n\nSpell phase abilities: Bone Vortex Attack, Skull Cast Attack, Levitation Spell, Falling Corpses Spell, Summon Minions Spell, Labyrinth Heal Attack. </br>\nHunt phase abilities: Darkness encases the player while the Lich hunts its prey. Don't let it come to close.</br>\nDeformation phase.\n\n\n<li>How to summon the Corrupted Champion:</li>\n\nCollect the three bone staff pieces (Ominous Bone Staff Fragment) from the Ruins structure. Every Ruin has a unique fragment (upper, middle and lower bone staff fragment).</br>\nObtain a bone dagger from an Acolyte, or craft it yourself.</br>\nHold a glass bottle in your offhand and start killing villager with the bone dagger. You'll get a Vial of Blood. Fill the vial to the limit.</br>\nFind the Lich Prison structure, a large floating island above the oceans.</br>\nWait until it is night, place the bone staff pieces (from upper to lower) on the dark corrupted deepslate blocks in front of the altar (they should fairly stand out).</br>\nPour the Vial of Blood into the altar.</br>\n\nVoil√†, you unleashed pure evil into the world, probably causing the death of thousands of innocent people and very likely your own.\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Mobs </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Skeleton Creeper: a faster undead variant of the creeper. It may has lost his destructive powers, but its haunting appearance will blind you.</li>\n<li>Acolyte: a darker representative of the illager family. If he'll find you, your bones will serve him as a new weapon.</li>\n<li>Reaper: Ghosts? Here, in a spooky graveyard mod? No... The reaper takes this place.</li>\n<li>Ghoul: a deformed revenant, hold together only by his rage on the living.</li>\n<li>Revenant: the animated remains of a once human being.</li>\n<li>Nightmare: a deformed creature that moves quicker than it seems. Better stay away and never look at it.</li>\n<li>Wraith: haunting those who dare to desecrate its coffin.</li>\n<li>Corrupted Illager: a fast undead version of the illagers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Blocks and Items</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Corruption: ‚Ü∏·îë‚à∑Íñå ·îë„É™‚Ü∏ ·í∑‚çä‚ïéÍñé ·í≤·îë‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ‚Ñ∏ Ã£ ·í∑‚à∑</li>\n<li>Sarcophagus: a final resting place now turned into storage space.</li>\n<li>Coffin: a final wooden resting place in all wood variants.</li>\n<li>Glazed Urn: a beautiful ornated urn, that serves as storage.</li>\n<li>Small Urn: a simple urn, that serves as storage.</li>\n<li>Fire Brazier: a dark cryptic iron bowl, displaying soul flames or flames when ignited.</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Ingot: an ashen version of iron</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Block: decorative steel-like block</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Door/Trapdoor: dark version of the iron door and trapdoor, but no need for redstone to open them.</li>\n<li>Dark Iron Bars: like vanilla iron bars, but dark and matching the theme.</li>\n<li>Skeletons: a fragile decoration block in many different forms that can be found in graveyard structures.</li>\n<li>Gravestone: edit the gravestone to create a memorial for your lost minecraft dog or horse.</li>\n<li>Ceramics: vases to decorate the graveyards (not craftable).</li>\n<li>Bone Dagger: crafted with bones, this weapon is used in dark rituals. It may also be useful for breaking glass.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Join my Discord for help, request or ideas!</h3>\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/8JgHeQ9eeQ\">\n<p> </p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5z3mhof.png\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\">\n</a>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Bugs and Source code </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/finallion/The-Graveyard-FORGE-/issues\">Github issue tracker</a>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Dependencies </h3>\n<p> </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib\">Geckolib for Forge</a>\n","published":"2022-06-05T13:58:25.068220Z","updated":"2024-04-07T16:52:45.922565Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":52089,"followers":71,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["sEPLZFn6","IPp5noAi","ItDmOXbB","DKXNgqie","TpOl3Wys","Nl7kbAXd","Q66WyQ3F","76pRxOAk","A0qu83FW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U1jdQuSf/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"TpOl3Wys","project_id":"U1jdQuSf","author_id":"tNo2siGn","featured":true,"name":"The Graveyard 2.5.2 (FORGE) for 1.19.2","version_number":"2.5.2","changelog":"Configurable boss fight.\nResolved pathfinding issues with custom blocks.\nAdjusted generation rates for lich prison structure.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-20T14:18:15.292398Z","downloads":21020,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d7d3c84a919d5c26a1241595ad51ed3791be06754919934b8bb27f5259bc5cd571b2397b1730f3315b93704a8672a1c03444cdf489a02678f2d7674188d95449","sha1":"3eec6480dac8d69a919e987514717ffbaecb8633"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U1jdQuSf/versions/TpOl3Wys/The_Graveyard_2.5.2_%28FORGE%29_for_1.19.2.jar","filename":"The_Graveyard_2.5.2_(FORGE)_for_1.19.2.jar","primary":false,"size":13558917,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"lxzmD9V4","project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ZET7ciVN","user":{"id":"tNo2siGn","username":"finallion","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74151350?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-05T12:45:26.616165Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"The_Graveyard_2.5.2_(FORGE)_for_1.19.2.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":null}
